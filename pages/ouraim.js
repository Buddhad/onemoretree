          Our carbon emissions must be drastically reduced to prevent the most
          dangerous effects of climate change. And how do we do that? By
          planting trees. One tree can sequester more than one ton of carbon
          dioxide in its lifetime. Our goal is to simplify the process so
          everyone can contribute, from individuals/volunteers to nurseries and
          companies alike, to help save the earth. According to facts, we still
          need to plant 8 million trees per year upto 20 years to save our
          planet, and we together can achieve this if we all play our roles in
          it and be a responsible earthling.

          Is getting outside and physically planting a tree not an option for
          you? Do you still want to do something? OneMoreTree has some great and
          easy steps for you to follow. You just have to go about and select a
          tree and get your saplings into the earth. This initiative works with
          people whose business deals with trees and plantations. Contributors
          can pick the type of tree they want, from Neem to Eucalyptus,we have a
          long list of distributors listed with us and place an order. Following
          that , those orders will be forwarded to the other trees selling
          businesses and other small scale planters who acts like a distributor
          for us. But thats not only it, we also give a plateform to the young
          climate enthusiasts to lend their hand in saving the Earth, promote
          them by providing a leaderboard and prizes for the top saviours and
          also contribute to other initiatives working towards saving the world
          with the help of a bit of margin we are keeping in the model.
